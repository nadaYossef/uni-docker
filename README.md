# uni-docker
## Name : Nada Youssef Ismail  

Firstly, I used google colab notebook in "paragraphs.ipynb" to write a code cell by cell that cleans, preprocesses, visualize, count the frequency of the words of "random_paragraphs.txt" which I also uploaded in my google colab notebook.
Then, I converted the ipynb file to py file in valid syntax in order to fit in for dockerfile.
Afterwards I created the "requirements.txt" which contains the necessary dependencies for python script and finally added them to "Dockerfile" . Then, I used docker app with build-run functions inside the command prompt to finally implement and run the image on the app itself.
